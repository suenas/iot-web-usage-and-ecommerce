\section{Iot Devices : RFID, NFC, Beacons and Sensors}

As introduced in \ref{section:iot}, The Internet of Things (IoT) describes an ecosystem or network of Internet-connected objects able to collect and transfer data using embedded sensors. This ecosystem is vast but can be organised into a number of major dimensions that are discussed below: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) } is a technology predominantly applied to one-way inventory tracking and supply chain problems. Packages are affixed with passive RFID tags containing important product information that are detectable to a distance of 100 meters by stationary readers. RFID tags are comprised of a small antenna and a silicon chip capable of storing the product information to facilitate its identification. The tags are remarkably small, and can be effectively integrated with adhesive labels attached to cases and pallets, incorporated into security cards, or even implanted in pets, to name just a few examples.
  
  The primary difference between RFIDs and the most common electronic barcode mechanism is that barcode readers require ``line-of-site". In other words, barcode readers must directly see the barcode lines in order to properly read the data, and this reading can be done only one barcode at a time. The RFID, on the other hand, does not require a direct reading as
tags can be scanned through a variety of materials. From an IoT perspective, RFID readers are powerful mechanisms not only to read and write data across networks of RFID tags, but also to transfer automatically large amounts of data to any type of data cloud or backend system.

  \item \textbf{Near Field Communication (NFC) } comprises a set of close-range wireless communication standards offering functions similar to the most common Bluetooth and RFID technologies. Much like RFID, NFC can detect and access data from special tags but have the additional advantage of being suitable for virtually unlimited applications because information can be easily retrieved from any conventional NFC-enabled device. Similar to Bluetooth technology, NFC supports two-way secure data exchange with a simple tap or wave among devices.
  
  Currently, NFC is already incorporated into over 1 billion devices globally, including an increasing number of tablets, PCs, household appliances, electronic devices, gaming consoles and smartphones. For enhanced security and control, NFC operates only when devices are in close proximity (approximately 10 centimetres), thus making this technology optimal for more protected applications like financial transactions and secure login access at a particular location. 
 
  \item \textbf{Beacons} \label{beacons} collectively refer to small wireless devices that are capable of transmitting simple radio signals embedded within a unique identification number. At any time, a nearby device such as a smartphone using Bluetooth Low Energy technology can detect the transmitted signals, reading the beaconâ€™s ID, calculating the distance to the beacon and, depending on the result, triggering an action in a beacon-compatible mobile app. 
  
  Despite the simplistic mechanism, beacons represent a substantial technological advancement and have opened new opportunities to allow more precise tracking for indoor positioning and behaviour compared with standard GPS technology.
  
  The simple communication associated with beacons, which importantly is not reliant on significant power consumption, unfolds a wide range of new seamless interactions with application in numerous areas. The retail sector, for example, is currently one of the most popular fields in which beacon technology is employed because it offers an unprecedented way to track in-store interactions between customers and product displays, ultimately resulting in more personalised offers and a better retail experience based on the acquired data. Additional applications of the beacon technology range from supporting and improving physical navigation in large spaces such as museums, airports and stadiums, to assisting impaired people in public transportation.

  \item \textbf{Sensors} are pieces of hardware responsible for monitoring processes, taking measurements and collecting data. There are literally infinite measurements that can be gathered by sensor arrays, ranging from temperature to proximity, from pressure to water quality, and from gas detection to liquid level tracking. A wide variety of devices currently include these sensors, and current trends indicate that we are witnessing a move towards multi-sensors platforms capable of simultaneously incorporating different sensing elements. In the retail sector, for example, it is possible to make the store shelves ``smarter" by providing visibility from the product's arrival to final sale thanks to a combination of shelf sensors, smart displays, digital price tags and high-resolution cameras. In fact, sensor-based technology now enables the retail businesses to precisely determine product volume on store shelves as well as in stock rooms, leading to more efficient product ordering and restocking. A final illustration of sensor application is the next-generation of personalised self-tracking products in the form of wearables and smartwatches. Examples include combinations of accelerometers, GPS, temperature and heart rate sensors that provide a comprehensive data insight on the activity of the user.

\section{Big Data and Predictive Analysis applications}

The concept of Big Data relates directly to the Internet of Things. IoT devices can collect terabytes of data over very short time frames, thus emphasising the importance of being able to support the efficient processing and interpretation of data as it is collected.

The power of IoT devices in generating profile data at an incredibly high rate can be coupled with contemporary paradigms in digital communication (see chapter \ref{section:data-web-mining}). Social network platforms, for instance, are sources of endless data that describes not only user preferences and behaviours but also their navigation patterns and daily activities, at any time. This vast volume of ``Big Data", available in a whole array of formats and growing constantly, provides unparalleled opportunities for addressing any number of socially-important questions.

To obtain economic value from Big Data, companies are investing in advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to efficiently process data, create products, and implement solutions that extend well beyond traditional systems currently used for managing and storing information. This includes novel approaches supporting high calculation inclination that are efficient at sorting data in a structured and meaningful manner to detect relationships and patterns in complex data streams. This new approach to data management differs from what companies used to do when priorities were bound to an IT level governance only, and they were solely accessed by a restricted set of users. Moreover, it also becomes vital for a company to identify new sources of big data as they are available on the market, and quickly incorporating them into the data management platform following a continuous improvement logic.

It is challenging to forecast the added value brought by Big Data analysis to the various disciplines in which they can be applied. However, we can already affirm that it has been improving the quality of the forecasts that contribute to more prudent decisions supported by more robust empirical evidence. 
In fact, Big Data analysis constitutes a fantastic instrument in the field of decision-making by minimising the risks and reducing the consequences of inadvertent human errors. For example, the marketing department of an organisation could potentially leverage big data for increasing marketing intelligence by predicting customer interests. At the same time, Big Data could be employed to provide better forecasts of product stock replenishment, and to optimise production requests.

In summary, the potential applications mentioned above represent the core of the predictive analysis notion: the practice of extracting information from Big Data with the goal of determining patterns and predicting future outcomes and possible trends. 

It is also important to remark that this kind of analysis does not offer a precise assessment of what will occur in the future, but rather they forecast the likelihood of particular outcomes with an acceptable level of reliability. This often includes what-if scenarios and risk assessments.

Focusing on the Marketing intelligence example mentioned above, it is important to fully understand the benefits of using Predictive Analysis. Digital companies have been increasingly embracing that idea because it offers a better and more constructive customer experience on all points of contact between the business itself and its clients. This can increase customer loyalty and, by extension, economic returns.

More specifically, this outcome can be achieved by using sophisticated algorithms and mathematical models on top of the datasets of customers activity, accessible from Big Data sources. Eventually, this data gets sanitised, structured, filtered, and finally grouped in a meaningful way. 

The behaviours and patterns of interaction detected by this analysis process can indicate, for example, a more appealing product offer with a major chance of conversion for particular segments of customer profile.

Different typologies and techniques are used to perform enhanced analysis for behavioural prediction. A few of the major approaches are discussed in the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clustering or Unsupervised learning}: This methodology seeks to group similar individuals, identifying behaviour patterns on a given customer base with high precision. These algorithms can process hundreds of attributes, aiming at identifying the characteristics that best discriminate individuals according to their actions. The underlying notion is that, statistically, distinct groups of individuals behave in similar ways. 
    
    Group clusters obtained with this process are similar to groups determined through a priori classification; the only fundamental difference between the two methodologies is that clustering or unsupervised learning allows individuals to be categorised into different groups based solely on data, and not on pre-conceived attribute differences. 
    
    Clusters types can differ depending mostly on the criteria by which customers are grouped. Product-based clusters, for example, collate all customers who tend to buy products or combinations of several products in the same category. By contrast, brand-based clusters focus on grouping customers who prefer certain brands instead of others, while behaviour-based clusters combine consumers with similar buying behaviours. Creating specific clusters allows marketing managers to better identify the most effective way to address each customer type.

    \item \textbf{Propensity models or Supervised learning}: This approach is based on probabilistic models using advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks, logistic regression, random forest, and genetic algorithms. The main purpose of these procedures is to predict future customer behaviour based on past examples. Over time, these algorithms become more efficient, improving predictions as more data is collected.

    \item \textbf{Reinforcement learning and Collaborative filtering}: This increasingly popular technique has been identified in a number of major applications, one of the most famous being the ability of companies to recommend products to specific customers, driving specific purchases. The recommendations are targeted and tailor-made for the client and they are defined by considering the entire relationship between customer and brand. For this reason, they can upsell products for higher value, cross-sell them to same category items, or dynamically link them to other products based on the modelled associations.

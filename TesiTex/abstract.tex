Marketing personalization is one of the essential elements for marketers to focus on in the next few years. In order to personalize the experiences of their customers, brands must overcome hard challenges such as learning their behavior while they interact with the brand itself and delivering a unique experience for each one of them based on the understanding of their individual preferences.

If in the past brands had not enough data to understand their customer at a personal level nowadays things are transitioning towards an entirely different scenario where big data plays a fundamental role. In fact and for the first time, companies are capable of distinguishing one customer from another beyond the mere demographic dimensions leveraging the information collected both in the virtual and the physical world analyzing and detecting patterns in their behaviors.

In this paper, we describe how this is achievable combining both findings coming from web data mining analysis and Internet Of Things devices tracking applying Model Driven Engineering techniques in order to serve a better tailored and more effective experience to the users interacting with the brand online.
